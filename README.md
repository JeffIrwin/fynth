# fynth: a fortran synthesizer

Project _fynth_ is pronounced as _synth_, because the lowercase letter _S_ is
written as _f_.  [Typesetting](https://github.com/JeffIrwin/cali) is hard ok!

# Build and run

Use [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/), the fortran package manager, with commands such as these:
```bash
fpm build
fpm run
```
<!-- fpm test -- does nothing yet -->

# Disambiguation

There is an unrelated although not dissimilar project also named fynth:  https://github.com/folkertvanheusden/fynth
